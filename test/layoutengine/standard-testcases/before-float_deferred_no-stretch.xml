  <info>
    <p>
      Test for before-floats. On a two-page document, when no stretching is
      allowed between blocks, when the float citation is on the first page and
      there is not enough room for the float, it should be placed on the top of
      the second page.
    </p>
    <p>
      When no stretching is available, only "too short" nodes are created. When
      there is not enough room to place the float, a too short node is created
      with added demerits for the deferred float. This results in higher
      demerits than for previous too short nodes, which then are preferred
      whereas they create underfull pages.
