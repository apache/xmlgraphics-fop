  <title>FOP 0.92 beta</title>
  <p>
    This is the third release after the big redesign effort. FOP 0.92 beta has now
    stabilized the API. In addition it contains many bug fixes and new features.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would like to encourage you to download the code and to play with it. 
    We're still in the process of stabilizing 
    the code. We welcome any feedback you might have and even more, any
    other form of help to get the project forward.
  </p>
  <p>Caveats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This release is still a beta release. If you intend to use this software in a production
      environment, please perform careful testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      The API has changed between 0.91beta this release.
      Please consult the <a href="0.94/upgrading.html">"Upgrading"</a> page for details.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may experience different behaviour compared to version 0.20.5.
      Please consult the <a href="0.94/upgrading.html">"Upgrading"</a> page for details.

    <li>
      Auto table layout is not implemented, yet.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Footnotes may overlap with text of the region-body in multi-column 
      documents.

    </li>
    <li>
      Preserved linefeeds in fo:character are not handled correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
      An empty block currently produces a fence for stacking constraints
      which it shouldn't.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are several small problems around white space handling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Images currently don't shrink so they fit on a page when they are 
      too big and shrinking is allowed to happen.
    </li>
    <li>
      Block-level content in fo:inlines may produce unwelcome results.
    </li>
    <li>
      inline-container may not work as expected.

      leaders with leader-pattern="use-content" may not work as expected.
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
      White space on direct inline-level children of a marker is not 
      handled correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
      If two consecutive pages don't have the same available width, the 
      content currently isn't properly fit into the available space on
      the new page.
    </li>
    <li>
      background-images on page-number-citations are not placed correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Not all FO elements can be referenced by their "id", most notably:
      table-body, table-header, table-footer and table-row.
    </li>
    <li>
      The backgrounds of table-body, table-header, table-footer and 
      table-column are not painted, yet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Border and padding conditionality are not supported on table-cells, yet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Copy/Paste from PDF content in Acrobat Reader is not supported for
      text using embedded TrueType fonts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Column balancing in multi-column documents may not work as expected

    </li>
    <li>
      Omitting fo:table-column or having fo:table-column without a column-width 
      and attempting to create columns implicitly from the first
      table row is not implemented, yet (<a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35656">Bugzilla #35656</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Internal basic-links don't point to the exact location on a page, yet, as they
      did in 0.20.5. Currently you land in the upper left corner of the page.
    </li>

  <title>FOP 0.20.5</title>
  <p>This was the last release in the 0.20.x series (aka maintenance branch).</p>
  <p>Important changes since the last release (0.20.4):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some hyphenation patterns (cs, da, de, de_DR, el, en, en_US, fr, nl,
      no, sk, tr) have been removed due to licensing reasons
      (en_GB hyphenation has been renamed to en).
      We're still working on this issue
      (see <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/FOPAudits/March2003">
      Wiki</a> for details).
    </li>
    <li>Documentation is now built with <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">
        Forrest</a> (version 0.4). You need to install Forrest if you want build the docs
        yourself. (See
        <a href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/your-project.html">Using Forrest</a>)
    </li>
    <li>The following JARs have been updated:
        Xerces to version 2.2.1, Xalan to version 2.4.1 and Batik to version 1.5beta4.
    </li>
    <li>FOP has been compiled with Jimi support, but Jimi is not included in the
        FOP distribution. To use it, first download
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">Jimi</a>, then extract
        the archive, then
        copy JimiProClasses.zip to FOP's lib dir and rename it to jimi-1.0.jar.
    </li>
    <li>FOP has been compiled with JAI support, but JAI is not included in the
        FOP distribution. To use it, simply install
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai">JAI</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Links in PDF won't generate multiple link rectangles anymore. If this causes
        a problem you can set the system property "links.merge" to "no".
    </li>
    <li>FOP has been compiled with cryptography support. See 
      <a href="0.94/pdfencryption.html">
      PDF encryption</a> for details about installation and usage.
    </li>
    <li>The behaviour of leader has changed. See
      <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19341">bug #19341</a>,
      <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19465">bug #19465</a>
      and <code>leader.fo</code> (examples).
    </li>
    <li>
      For a more detailed list of changes, see the CHANGES file in the root of the
      FOP distribution.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <title>FOP 0.20.4</title>
  <p>Important changes since 0.20.3:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>FOP should now work with any JAXP1.1 compliant parser/transformer.
         It has been successfully tested with Xerces/Xalan, Saxon and JDK1.4
         (which includes Crimson and Xalan).
       </li>
       <li>The following JARs have been updated:
         Xerces to version 2.0.1, Xalan to version 2.3.1 and Batik to version 1.5beta2.
      </li>
      <li>FOP has been compiled with Jimi support this time
        but you still have to download
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">Jimi</a>
        and copy it to lib/ to get PNG support (no need to build FOP yourself though).
      </li>
      <li>Building FOP with JDK1.2 does not work. Running is ok except
        support for additional truetype fonts in AWT Viewer.
      </li>
      <li>Logging has been changed from LogKit to Avalon's Logger Interface.
        (see <a href="0.94/embedding.html">Embedding</a> for details).
      </li>
      <li>Building under JDK 1.4:
         You need to add a method in
         <code>src/org/apache/fop/svg/PDFGraphics2D.java</code>
         (search for jdk1.4 and remove the comments)
      </li>
      <li>To decrease the size of the distributions, ant, xml-docs, design-docs
        and the hyphenation sources have been removed from the binary distribution.
        Javadocs have been removed from the source distribution (use
        <code>build javadocs</code> to generate them).
      </li>
      <li>Documentaion generation is broken in the maintenance branch at the moment
       (Stylebook needs xerces1). The docs for this release are generated from the trunk.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a more detailed list of changes, see the CHANGES file in the root of the FOP distribution.
      </li>
      </ul>

<section>
  <title>FOP 0.20.3</title>
  <p>Important Information:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>This version supports the
         <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015/">XSL-FO Version 1.0
         W3C Recommendation</a> syntax. So don't forget to update your
         Stylesheets:
         <br/>Just rename the <code>master-name</code> property to <code>master-reference</code>
         on <code>fo:page-sequence</code>, <code>fo:single-page-master-reference</code>,
         <code>fo:repeatable-page-master-reference</code> and
         <code>fo:conditional-page-master-reference</code>.</li>
       <li>JDK 1.2 (or later) is required</li>
       <li>Jimi has been removed for licensing reasons
         <br/>If you need PNG support you have to download
           <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">Jimi</a>,
           copy it to lib/ and build FOP yourself</li>
      <li>Building under JDK 1.4:
        <br/>You need to add a method in
         <code>src/org/apache/fop/svg/PDFGraphics2D.java</code>
