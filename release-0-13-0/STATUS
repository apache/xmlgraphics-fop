STATUS

Things worked on:

rewrite of the org.apache.fop.layout in a new package (implements xsl 2000) [James Tauber]
image support [Eric Schaeffer, Pankaj Narula]
simple-links [Arved Sandstrom]
SVG support [Keiron Liddle][Torsten Friebe]
more borders, padding and absolute positioning [Jon Smirl]
smooth shading in PDF [Steve Coffman]


Things to do:

Get images working
[PARTIAL] Get padding working
[DONE] Incorporate Arved Sandstrom's simple-link implementation
[PARTIAL] Implement basic keeps
[PARTIAL] Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's further table fixes
Implement MessageHandler (or similar)
Support XSL Working Draft 12 January 2000

Other Bugs to fix:

colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page
simple-link doesn't seem to work (I think I, JKT, broke it)

with AWT Previewer:

- currently the layout process uses PDF fonts. This gives sometimes
  trouble with java.awt.Font 
- we need some progress messages even if the process itself is fast
- GIF format is supported by the viewer, but disabled in FOP. BMP is
  not done, because there are no standard libraries.
- more comments/english comments
- first preview is painted twice (flashing screen)
- should "preview" be an option when calling FOP instead of having
  it's own main method?

History

Done since 0.12.1 release
- using Ant to build Fop instead of make [Giacomo Pati]
- borders, padding and absolute positioning [Jon Smirl]

0.12.1 release
to make the bug fix on XTCommandLine available to non developers
basic support for padding-{top,left,bottom,right} on blocks.
implemented simple-link (don't think it works, though)
XTCommandLine now works again
background color works on list-block
list-blocks can now be in table-cell

Done for 0.12.0 release:

Make sure Makefiles work
Switch to using Status object as return from layout()
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's fix to tables in static-content
Incorporate Kelly Campell's fixes to GifJpegImage
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's background colour implementation
  (actually used different approach with background colour as trait)
