    <release version="FOP Trunk">
    </release>
    <release version="0.91beta" date="23 Dec 2005">
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="update">
        Deprecated Fop constructors that use integer constants to select the
        output format have been removed in favor or the constructors that use
        MIME types.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="MM" type="fix">
        Fixed a bug where the linefeed-treatment property value "preserve" was not
        honoured when used in conjunction with text-align="center".
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix" fixes-bug="37964">
        Bugfix: hard breaks with even-page or odd-page were not handled correctly
        when spaces were surrounding the break.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="update">
        Changed the XMLHandler interface so it doesn't report the MIME type it
        supports but instead can report whether it supports a particular Renderer
        implementation. XMLHandlers are now configurable.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Fixed a bug where SVG content could be clipped when rendered to PostScript.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Changed the way resolutions are handled. The single resolution in the user
        agent got split up into source and target resolutions. For more info, see
        the updated documentation. Note: backwards-incompatible change!
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix" fixes-bug="37875">
        Bugfix: Some content inside a table-header may not have been renderered on
        pages n &gt; 1 in certain conditions.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="MM" type="fix">
        Fixed a bug where an empty line, i.e. a block containing only a &amp;nbsp;,
        was not rendered at all.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Fixed a bug where the area for a finished cell that is broken over pages was 
        created once for each row it was spanned over instead of only once.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="add">
        Added checks that warn about tables and block-containers that are wider than
        the available content area.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix" fixes-bug="37880">
        Bugfix: Footnotes were lost if the footnote appeared in centered text.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="update">
        Improved log and error messages in a number of places by adding additional
        context information that should make it easier to find the location in the
        source files.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Fix to correct image sizes in RTF output.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="add">
        First attempt at SVG support in RTF output. SVG images are converted to 300dpi JPEG
        images internally.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="update">
        Additional checks to detect text overflows. The overflow property is now properly
        handled where applicable.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="update">
        Source location information improved. If location information is not available,
        the context information is provided based on text content.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="add">
        The command-line now automatically sets two parameters for any XSLT transformation:
        "fop-output-format" contains the MIME type of the currently selected output format,
        "fop-version" contains FOP's version number.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        The output file is now deleted when an exception occurs when calling FOP from
        the command-line.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix: Areas for table-cells that are broken over more than one page are now
        generated even if all its content is already painted on a previous page. This
        fixes strange effects like a table grid that is not completely painted.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix" fixes-bug="37828">
        Bugfix: Column balancing produced strange break decisions in certain multi-column
        documents with large amounts of text.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="add">
        Added an alternative set of rules for calculating text indents which tries to mimic
        the behaviour of many commercial FO implementations that chose to break the rules
        in the FO specification in order to better meet the natural expectations of 
        inexperienced FO users.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix" fixes-bug="37815" due-to="Tom Craddock">
        Bugfix: The combination of content-width="scale-to-fit" and content-height="100%"
        did not work as expected due to a datatype conversion bug.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix" fixes-bug="37813">
        Bugfix: A span="all" on the first block cause a subsequent page break and the first block
        didn't span all columns.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix: Self-created OutputStreams in PNG Renderer were not properly closed.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="update">
        The border-collapse property on fo:table is now forced to the value "separate" until the collapsing
        border has been implemented.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="add">
        font-family list still not fully supported but a comma-separated list is now properly tokenized.
        FOP will now go through all fonts in the list to find one that is available, but it doesn't 
        do so per character, yet. 
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="add">
        Implemented "Overconstrained Geometry" rules (5.3.4, XSL 1.0) for the most important cases.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix: Relatively positioned BlockViewports (from block-containers) caused the paint 
        cursor not be be properly advanced when space-before or space-after were present.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix: Space resolution was incomplete for content in table-cells. Conditional elements
        didn't get removed.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        The validation check for non-zero borders and padding on a region-* and for empty static-content 
        elements is now turned off when relaxed validation is active to improve compatibility with 
        FO documents written for other FO implementations.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix for "/ by zero" ArithmeticExceptions when an URL to a non-existing image is used 
        and content-width and/or content-height is used.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix for a multi-threading problem:
        propertyListTable initialization moved from the constructor to a static block in FONode.
        This fixes NullPointerExceptions in PropertyList.
      </action>
      <action context="Code" dev="JM" type="fix">
        Bugfix for placement of text inside a text area when borders are present in PostScript output.
