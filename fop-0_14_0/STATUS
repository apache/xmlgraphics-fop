**** THINGS TO DO **** 

Support XSL Working Draft 27 March 2000 

1.One category of tasks will be to implement missing formatting objects. 
  There are 6  such objects: 

  fo:character 
  fo:leader 
  fo:table-and-caption 
  fo:table-header 
  fo:multi-case 
  fo:wrapper 

2.A second category of tasks will be to update existing objects. 
  This typically entails renaming modifications. There are at least 3 of these: 

  fo:page-sequence-master 
  fo:single-page-master-reference 
  fo:repeatable-page-master-reference 

3.A third category of tasks is to retire obsolescent objects. The primary issue 
  here seems to be the migration of FOP from officially supporting 
  DisplayGraphic and InlineGraphic FO's to officially supporting at least an 
  ExternalGraphic FO, and ideally also the InstreamForeignObject FO, the latter 
  aimed at SVG support. 

4.A fourth, and not insignificant, category of tasks is to decide upon and 
  implement all reasonable properties required by the specification. This 
  also means that at this point, until further review, no FO can be considered 
  to be compliant.

5.A fifth category of tasks is the ongoing effort to promote maintainability, 
write 
  more and better documentation, and to refine the build process. 
  a) Don't use 'make' any longer and make sure that build.sh and build.bat work 
  b) Add the property files to the source code (how is the vote on this?) 
  c) update the examples to the new spec 
  d) add examples so that all the FOs supported are used in some example 

**** Bugs ****

- SVG linearGradients don't appear the same as in other SVG Viewers
- colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page 
- no SVG support in AWTCommandLine 
- keep-next doesn't work and doubles the text lines which should be moved to the next page
- pdf files created with Fop don't print correctly on postscript printers
- lists containing list do not keep their indentation correctly over a page boundary

with AWT Previewer: 

- currently the layout process uses PDF fonts. This gives sometimes 
  trouble with java.awt.Font 
- we need some progress messages even if the process itself is fast 
- GIF format is supported by the viewer, but disabled in FOP. BMP is 
  not done, because there are no standard libraries. 
- more comments/english comments 
- first preview is painted twice (flashing screen) 
- should "preview" be an option when calling FOP instead of having 
  it's own main method?
