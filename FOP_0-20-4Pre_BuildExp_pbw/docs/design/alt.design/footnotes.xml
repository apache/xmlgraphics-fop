    <s1 title="Implementing footnotes in FOP">
      <p>
	Footnotes present difficulties for page layout primarily
	because their point of invocation in the flow is different
	from their point of appearance in the area tree.  All of the
	content lines of a footnote may appear on the same page as its
	invocation point, all may appear on a following page, or the
	lines may be split over a page or pages.  (This characteristic
	leads to another problem when a footnote overflows the last
	page of flow content, but that difficulty will not be
	discussed here.)  This note considers some aspects of the
	implementation of footnotes in a galley-based design.
      </p>
      <s2 title="Footnotes and galleys">
	<p>
	  In the structure described in the <link href=
	  "../galleys.html" >introduction to FOP galleys</link>,
	  footnotes would be pre-processed as galleys themselves, but
	  they would remain attached as subtrees to their points of
	  invocation in the main text.  Allocation to a
	  footnote-reference-area would only occur in the resolution
	  to Area nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  When footnotes are introduced, the communication between
	  galleys and layout manager, as mentioned <link href=
	  "../galleys.html#pre-processing" >above</link>, would be
	  affected.  The returned information would two b-p-d values:
	  the primary line-area b-p-d impact and the footnote b-p-d
	  impact.  The distinction is necessary for two reasons; to
	  alert the layout manager to the first footnote of the page,
	  and because the footnote b-p-d will always impact the
	  main-reference-area b-p-d, whereas the primary inline-area
	  may not, e.g. in the case of multiple span-areas.

      <s2 title="Multiple columns and footnotes">
	<note>
	  A possible method for multi-column layout and balancing
	  with footnotes, using a galley-based approach.
	</note>
	<p>
	  This note assumes a galley, as discussed <link href=
	  "../galleys.html" >elsewhere</link>, flowing text with
	  footnotes and possibly other blocks into a possibly
	  multi-column area.  The logic of flowing into multiple
	  columns is trivially applied to a single column.  The galley
	  is manipulated within the context of the <em>layout
	  tree</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Associated with the galley are two sets of data.
	  One contains the maps of all "natural" break-points and
	  the of all hyphenation break-points.  This set is
	  constructed at the time of construction of the galley and
	  is a constant for a given galley.  The second contains
	  dynamic data which represents one possible attempt to lay
	  out the galley.  There may be multiple sets of such data
	  to reflect varying attempts.  The data of this set are,
	  essentially, representations of line-areas, with the supporting
	  information necessary to determine these line-areas.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The line-area data includes the boundaries within the
	  galley of each line-area, the boundaries of each column
	  and the boundaries of the "page", or main area.  When a
	  line-area boundary occurs at a hyphenation point, a
	  "virtual hyphen" is assumed and accounted for in the
	  i-p-d.  As mentioned, individual footnote galleys will
	  hang from the parent galley.  The associated data of the
	  footnote galleys is similar: a once-only break-points map,
	  and one or more line-area maps.  No column boundaries are
	  required, but a page boundary is required at the end of
	  the last footnote or where a footnote breaks across a page
	  boundary.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A number of b-p-d values are also maintained.  For each
	  line-area, the b-p-d, the main area b-p-d increment, the
	  footnote b-p-d increment and the footnote's page-related
	  b-p-d increment are required.  The main-area b-p-d
	  increments for any particular line-area are dependent on
	  the column position of the line-area.  Total b-p-d's are
	  also kept: total footnote b-p-d, total main area b-p-d,
	  and totals for each column.<br/><br/>

	<p>
	  Columns are balanced dynamically in the galley preliminary
	  layout.  While the galley retains its basic linear
	  structure, the accompanying data structures accomplish
	  column distribution and balancing.  As each line-area is
	  added, the columns are re-balanced.  <strong>N.B.</strong>
	  This re-balancing involves only some of the dynamic data
	  associated with the participating galley(s).  The data
	  structures associating breakpoints with the beginning and
	  end of individual line areas does not change in
	  re-balancing; only the association of line-area with column,
	  and, possibly, the various impact values for each line-area.
