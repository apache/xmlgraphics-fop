      <note label="Important">Please don't write to any developer directly if you need help on using FOP. Only if you submit questions to the <link href="maillist.html#fop-user">FOP User Mailing List</link> will other FOP users be able to profit from answers given to your question. Another point is that a developer may have gone inactive or is on holidays in which case you may not get an answer in time.</note>
