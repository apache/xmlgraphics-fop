      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        FOP supports encryption of PDF output, thanks to Patrick
        C. Lankswert. This feature is commonly used to prevent
        unauthorized viewing, printing, editing, copying text from the
        document and doing annotations. It is also possible to ask the
        user for a password in order to view the contents. Note that
        there already exist third party applications which can decrypt
        an encrypted PDF without effort and allow the aforementioned
        operations, therefore the degree of protection is limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        For further information about features and restrictions regarding PDF
        encryption, look at the documentation coming with Adobe Acrobat or the
        technical documentation on the Adobe web site.
      </p>

    <section>
      <title>Usage (command line)</title>
      <p>
        Encryption is enabled by supplying any of the encryption related
        options.
      </p>
      <p>
        An owner password is set with the <code>-o</code> option. This
        password is actually used as encryption key. Many tools for
        PDF processing ask for this password to disregard any
        restriction imposed on the PDF document.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no owner password has been supplied but FOP was asked to apply some
        restrictions, a random password is used. In this case it is obviously
        impossiible to disregard restrictions in PDF processing tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user password, supplied with the <code>-u</code> option, will
        cause the PDF display software to ask the reader for this password in
        order to view the contents of the document. If no user password was
        supplied, viewing the content is not restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further restrictions can be imposed by using the following command-line options:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Option</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-noprint</code></td>
            <td>disable printing</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-nocopy</code></td>
            <td>disable copy/paste of content</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-noedit</code></td>
            <td>disable editing in Adobe Acrobat</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-noannotations</code></td>
            <td>disable editing of annotations</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-nofillinforms</code></td>
            <td>disable filling in forms</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-noaccesscontent</code></td>
            <td>disable text and graphics extraction for accessibility purposes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-noassembledoc</code></td>
            <td>disable assembling documents</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>-noprinthq</code></td>
            <td>disable high quality printing</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

      <title>Usage (embedded)</title>
      <p>
        When FOP is embedded in another Java application you need to set an 
        options map on the renderer. These are the supported options:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Option</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Values</th>
          <th>Default</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>encryption-length</td>
          <td>The encryption length in bit</td>
          <td>Any multiple of 8 between 40 and 128</td>
          <td>40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ownerPassword</td>
          <td>The owner password</td>
          <td>String</td>
          <td/>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>userPassword</td>
          <td>The user password</td>
          <td>String</td>
          <td/>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowPrint</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows printing of the PDF</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowCopyContent</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows copy/paste of content</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowEditContent</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows editing in Adobe Acrobat</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowEditAnnotations</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows editing of annotations</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowFillInForms</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows filling in forms</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowAccessContent</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows text and graphics extraction for accessibility purposes</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowAssembleDocument</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows assembling document</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>allowPrintHq</td>
          <td>Allows/disallows high quality printing</td>
          <td>"TRUE" or "FALSE"</td>
          <td>"TRUE"</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <note>
        Encryption is enabled as soon as one of these options is set.
      </note>
      <p>
        An example to enable PDF encryption in Java code:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
import org.apache.fop.pdf.PDFEncryptionParams;

[..]

FOUserAgent userAgent = fopFactory.newFOUserAgent();
useragent.getRendererOptions().put("encryption-params", new PDFEncryptionParams(
    null, "password", false, false, true, true));
Fop fop = fopFactory.newFop(MimeConstants.MIME_PDF, userAgent);
[..]]]></source>
      <p>
        The parameters for the constructor of PDFEncryptionParams are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>userPassword: String, may be null</li>
        <li>ownerPassword: String, may be null</li>
        <li>allowPrint: true if printing is allowed</li>
        <li>allowCopyContent: true if copying content is allowed</li>
        <li>allowEditContent: true if editing content is allowed</li>
        <li>allowEditAnnotations: true if editing annotations is allowed</li>
        <li>allowFillInForms: true if filling in forms is allowed.</li>
        <li>allowAccessContent: true if extracting text and graphics is allowed</li>
        <li>allowAssembleDocument: true if assembling document is allowed</li>
        <li>allowPrintHq: true if printing to high quality is allowed</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can set each value separately in the Map provided by 
        FOUserAgent.getRendererOptions() by using the following keys:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>user-password: String</li>
        <li>owner-password: String</li>
        <li>noprint: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>nocopy: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>noedit: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>noannotations: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>nofillinforms: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>noaccesscontent: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>noassembledoc: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
        <li>noprinthq: Boolean or "true"/"false"</li>
      </ol>

      <title>Environment</title>
      <p>
        In order to use PDF encryption, FOP has to be compiled with
        cryptography support. Currently, only <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html">JCE</a>
        is supported. JCE is part of JDK 1.4. For earlier JDKs, it can
        be installed separately. The build process automatically
        detects JCE presence and installs PDF encryption support if
        possible, otherwise a stub is compiled in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cryptography support must also be present at run time. In particular, a
        provider for the RC4 cipher is needed. Unfortunately, the sample JCE
        provider in Sun's JDK 1.4 does <strong>not</strong> provide RC4. If you
        get a message saying
      </p>
      <source>"Cannot find any provider supporting RC4"</source>
      <p>
        then you don't have the needed infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several commercial and a few Open Source packages which
        provide RC4. A pure Java implementation is produced by <a
        href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/">The Legion of the Bouncy
        Castle</a>. <a
        href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/jss/">Mozilla
        JSS</a> is an interface to a native implementation.

      <title>Installing a crypto provider</title>
      <p>
        The pure Java implementation from <a
        href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/">Bouncy Castle</a> is easy to
        install.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the binary distribution for your JDK version.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unpack the distribution. Add the jar file to your classpath. A
          convenient way to use the jar on Linux is to simply drop it into the
          FOP lib directory, it will be automatically picked up by
          <code>fop.sh</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the <code>java.security</code> file and add<br/>
          <code>security.provider.6=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider</code>,<br/>
          preferably at the end of the block defining the other crypto
          providers. For JDK 1.4 this is detailed on <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html#InstallProvider">Sun's web site</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you have any experience with Mozilla JSS or any other
        cryptography provider, please post it to the fop-user list.
