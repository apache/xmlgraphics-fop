    <title>Configuration File Basics</title>
    <p>
      The FOP configuration file is an XML file containing a variety of settings that are useful 
      for controlling FOP's behavior, and for helping it find resources that you wish it to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to get started using a FOP configuration file is to copy the sample found 
      at <code>{fop-dir}/conf/fop.xconf</code> to a location of your choice, and then to 
      edit it according to your needs.
      It contains templates for the various configuration options, most of which are commented 
      out. Remove the comments and change the settings for entries that you wish to use.
      Be sure to follow any instructions, including comments which specify the value range.
      Also, since the configuration file is XML, be sure to keep it well-formed.
    </p>
    <section id="general-available">
      <title>Making Configuration Available to FOP</title>
      <p>After creating your configuration file, you must tell FOP how to find it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If running FOP from the command-line, see the "-c" command-line option in 
          <a href="running.html">Running FOP</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If running FOP as an embedded application, see 
          <a href="embedding.html#config-external">Embedding, Using a Configuration File</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        See <a href="embedding.html#config-internal">Setting the Configuration Programmatically</a>
        for instructions on how to do so in an embedded environment.

          Setting this option to 'true' will cause FOP to strictly verify the contents of the
          FOP configuration file to ensure that defined resources (such as fonts and base
          URLs/directories) are valid and available to FOP.  Any errors found will cause FOP to

          Setting this option to 'false' causes FOP to be more forgiving about XSL-FO validity, 
          for example, you're allowed to specify a border on a region-body which is supported 
          by some FO implementations but is non-standard. Note that such a border would

          Setting this option to 'true' causes FOP to use an alternative rule set to determine
          text indents specified through margins, start-indent and end-indent. Many commercial
          FO implementations have chosen to break the XSL specification in this aspect. This
          option tries to mimic their behaviour. Please note that Apache FOP may still not
          behave exactly like those implementations either because FOP has not fully matched
          the desired behaviour and because the behaviour among the commercial implementations
          varies. The default for this option (i.e. false) is to behave exactly like the 
          specification describes.</td>

    <title>Renderer configuration</title>
    <p>
      Each Renderer has its own configuration section which is identified by the
      MIME type the Renderer is written for, ex. "application/pdf" for the PDF Renderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration for the PDF Renderer could look like this:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
  <renderers>
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList>
        <!-- provides compression using zlib flate (default is on) -->
        <value>flate</value>
      </filterList>
      <fonts>
        <font metrics-url="arial.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="arial.ttf">
          <font-triplet name="Arial" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
          <font-triplet name="ArialMT" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
        </font>
        <font metrics-url="arialb.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="arialb.ttf">
          <font-triplet name="Arial" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
          <font-triplet name="ArialMT" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
        </font>
      </fonts>
    </renderer>
    
    <renderer mime="application/postscript">
    <!-- etc. etc..... -->]]></source>
    <p>
      The details on the font configuration can be found on the separate <a href="fonts.html">Fonts</a> page.
      Note especially the section entitled <a href="fonts.html#register">Register Fonts with FOP</a>.
    </p>
    <section id="pdf-renderer">
      <title>Special Settings for the PDF Renderer</title>
      <p>
        The configuration element for the PDF renderer contains two elements. One is for the font configuration
        (please follow the link above) and one is for the "filter list". The filter list controls how the
        individual objects in a PDF file are encoded. By default, all objects get "flate" encoded (i.e. simply 
        compressed with the same algorithm that is also used in ZIP files). Most users don't need to change that
        setting. For debugging purposes, it may be desired not to compress the internal objects at all so the
        generated PDF commands can be read. In that case, you can simply use the following filter list. The 
        second filter list (type="image") ensures that all images still get compressed but also ASCII-85 encoded
        so the produced PDF file is still easily readable in a text editor.
      </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList>
        <value>null</value>
      </filterList>
      <filterList type="image">
        <value>flate</value>
        <value>ascii-85</value>
      </filterList>
      
      <fonts....
    </renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        Another (optional) setting specific to the PDF Renderer is an output color profile, an ICC 
        color profile which indicates the target color space the PDF file is generated for. This 
        setting is mainly used in conjunction with the <a href="pdfx.html">PDF/X</a> feature. 
        An example:
      </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
    <renderer mime="application/pdf">
      <filterList...
      
      <output-profile>C:\FOP\Color\EuropeISOCoatedFOGRA27.icc</output-profile>
      
      <fonts....
    </renderer>]]></source>
    </section>
    <section id="ps-renderer">
      <title>Special Settings for the PostScript Renderer</title>
      <p>
        Besides the normal font configuration (the same "fonts" element as for the PDF renderer) the PostScript
        renderer has an additional setting to force landscape pages to be rotated to fit on a page inserted into
        the printer in portrait mode. Set the value to "true" to activate this feature. The default is "false".
        Example:
      </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
    <renderer mime="application/postscript">
      <auto-rotate-landscape>true</auto-rotate-landscape>
      
      <fonts>
        <font metrics-url="arial.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="arial.ttf">
          <font-triplet name="Arial" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
          <font-triplet name="ArialMT" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
        </font>
        <font metrics-url="arialb.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="arialb.ttf">
          <font-triplet name="Arial" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
          <font-triplet name="ArialMT" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
        </font>
      </fonts>
    </renderer>]]></source>
    </section>
    <section id="pcl-renderer">
      <title>Special Settings for the PCL Renderer</title>
      <p>
        Non-standard fonts for the PCL renderer are made available through the Java2D subsystem which means that
        you don't have to do any custom font configuration in this case but you have to use the font names
        offered by Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, there are certain settings that control how the renderer handles various elements.
      </p>
<source><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/vnd.hp-PCL">
  <rendering>quality</rendering>
  <text-rendering>bitmap</text-rendering>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "rendering" setting is "speed" which causes borders 
        to be painted as plain rectangles. In this mode, no special borders (dotted, 
        dashed etc.) are available. If you want support for all border modes, set the
        value to "quality" as indicated above. This will cause the borders to be painted
        as bitmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "text-rendering" setting is "auto" which paints the
        base fonts using PCL fonts. Non-base fonts are painted as bitmaps through Java2D.
        If the mix of painting methods results in unwelcome output, you can set this
        to "bitmap" which causes all text to be rendered as bitmaps.

    <title>Apache FOP Font Config</title>
    <p>
      Apache FOP has special Font configuration considerations, which are explained
      in detail on the <a href="fonts.html">Fonts</a> page.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>When it does not work</title>

    <p>FOP searches the configuration file for the information it
expects, at the position it expects. When that information is not
present, FOP will not complain, it will just continue. When there is
other information in the file, FOP will not complain, it will just
ignore it. That means that when your configuration information is in
the file but in a different XML element, or in a different XML path,
than FOP expects, it will be silently ignored.</p>

      <p>Check the following possibilities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The format of the configuration file has changed
considerably between FOP 0.20.5 and FOP 1.0 and its beta versions. Did
you convert your file to the new format?</li>

        <li>The FOP distribution contains a schema for configuration
files, at src/foschema/fop-configuration.xsd. Did you validate your
configuration file against it? Add the following schema location to
the <code>schema</code> element:

<source><![CDATA[<fop
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=
"http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xmlgraphics/fop/trunk/src/foschema/fop-configuration.xsd?view=co">]]>
</source>

and run the configuration file through a validating schema
parser. Note that the schema cannot detect all errors, and that it is
stricter about the order of some elements than FOP itself is.</li>

        <li>Run FOP in debug mode (command line option
<code>-d</code>). This makes FOP report which configuration
information it finds. Check if FOP finds what you expect.</li>

      </ul>
