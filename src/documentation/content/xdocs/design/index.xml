  <title>Introduction</title>
<p>
The information here describes the design and architecture details for FOP.
Currently this is part of a redesign process for some of the core parts of
FOP.
  </p>
  <p>
The redesign is mainly focusing on some particular process involved
with the layout process when converting the FO tree into the Area Tree.
  </p>
<section>
  <title>Aims</title>
  <p>
The main aim for FOP is to comply with the spec and to be able to
process files of any size.
   </p>
  <p>
In achieving this aim we need to understand the problem and break it
into small problems that can be solved.
   </p>
  <p>
<ul>
<li>use SAX as input</li>
<li>process FO elements ASAP</li>
<li>dispose of unused memory, keep memory minimal</li>
<li>layout handles floats, footnotes and keeps in a simple straight forward way</li>
<li>id references are kept simple</li>
<li>pages are rendered ASAP, can be cached until resolved</li>
<li>renderers are totally responsible for their output format</li>
<li>output is sent to a stream</li>
</ul>
