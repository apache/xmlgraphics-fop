        <p>
          If the block-progression-dimension of the reference-area is
          larger than that of the viewport-area and the overflow trait
          for the reference-area is scroll, then the
          inline-scroll-amount and block-scroll-amount are determined
          by a scrolling mechanism, if any, provided by the
          <strong>user agent</strong>. Otherwise, both are zero.

        <title>5.1.3 Actual Values</title>
        <p>
          A computed value is in principle ready to be used, but a
          user agent may not be able to make use of the value in a
          given environment. For example, a <strong>user
            agent</strong> may only be able to render borders with
          integer pixel widths and may, therefore, have to adjust the
          computed width to an integral number of media pixels.

        <p>
          There is no XSL mechanism to specify a particular font;
          instead, a selected font is chosen from the fonts available
          to the <strong>User Agent</strong> based on a set of
          selection criteria. The selection criteria are the following
          font properties: "font-family", "font-style",
          "font-variant", "font-weight", "font-stretch", and
          "font-size", plus, for some formatting objects, one or more
          characters.

          <p>
            The merge-property-values function returns a value of the
            property whose name matches the argument, or if omitted
            for the property for which the expression is being
            evaluated. The value returned is the specified value on
            the last fo:multi-property-set, of the parent
            fo:multi-properties, that applies to the <strong>User
              Agent</strong> state. If there is no such value, the
            computed value of the parent fo:multi-properties is
            returned...

          <p>
            The test for applicability of a <strong>User
              Agent</strong> state is specified using the "active-state"
            property.

          <title>multi-property-set</title>
          <p>
            The fo:multi-property-set is used to specify an
            alternative set of formatting properties that, dependent
            on a <strong>User Agent</strong> state, are applied to the
            content.

          <p>
            The fo:title formatting object is used to associate a
            title with a given page-sequence. This title may be used
            by an interactive <strong>User Agent</strong> to identify
            the pages. For example, the content of the fo:title can be
            formatted and displayed in a "title" window or in a "tool
            tip".

        <p>
          ... When pages are used with a <strong>User Agent</strong>
          such as a Web browser, it is common that the each document
          has only one page. The viewport used to view the page
          determines the size of the page. When pages are placed on
          non-interactive media, such as sheets of paper, pages
          correspond to one or more of the surfaces of the paper.

            the inline-progression-dimension of the area.

            Dynamic effects, whereby user actions (including
            <strong>User Agent</strong> state) can influence the
            behavior and/or representation of portions of a document,
            can be achieved through the use of the formatting objects
            included in this section:

          <ul>
            <li>One-directional single-target links.</li>
            <li>
              The ability to switch between the display of two or more
              formatting object subtrees. This can be used for, e.g.,
              expandable/collapsible table of contents, display of an
              icon or a full table or graphic.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability to switch between different property values,
              such as color or font-weight, depending on a
              <strong>User Agent</strong> state, such as "hover".

            generated areas can borrow from the
            region-reference-area. It is left to the <strong>user
              agent</strong> to decide these limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            ... An interactive <strong>user agent</strong> may choose
            to create "hot links" to the footnotes from the
            footnote-citation, or create "hot links" to the
            before-floats from an implicit citation, instead of
            realizing conditional sub-regions.

          <title>Constraints:</title>
          <p>
            ... The <strong>user agent</strong> may make its own
            determination, after taking into account the intrusion
            adjustments caused by one or more overlapping side-floats,
            that the remaining space in the
            inline-progression-direction is insufficient for the next
            side-float or normal block-area. The <strong>user
              agent</strong> may address this by causing the next
            side-float or normal block-area to "clear" one of the
            relevant side-floats, as described in the "clear" property
            description, so the intrusion adjustment is sufficiently
            reduced. Of the side-floats that could be cleared to meet
            this constraint, the side-float that is actually cleared
            must be the one whose after-edge is closest to the
            before-edge of the parent reference-area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>user agent</strong> may determine sufficiency
            of space by using a fixed length, or by some heuristic
            such as whether an entire word fits into the available
            space, or by some combination, in order to handle text and
            images.

            other content is placed. If a subsequent page does not

          instead, a selected font is chosen from the fonts available
          to the <strong>User Agent</strong> based on a set of
          selection criteria. The selection criteria are the following
          font properties: "font-family", "font-style",
          "font-variant", "font-weight", "font-stretch", and
          "font-size", plus, for some formatting objects, one or more

            An &lt;absolute-size&gt; keyword refers to an entry in a
            table of font sizes computed and kept by the <strong>user
              agent</strong>. Possible values are:<br/>[ xx-small |

          <p>
            A &lt;relative-size&gt; keyword is interpreted relative to
            the table of font sizes and the font size of the parent
            element. Possible values are:<br/>[ larger | smaller
            ]<br/>For example, if the parent element has a font size
            of "medium", a value of "larger" will make the font size
            of the current element be "large". If the parent element's
            size is not close to a table entry, the <strong>user
              agent</strong> is free to interpolate between table
            entries or round off to the closest one. The <strong>user
              agent</strong> may have to extrapolate table values if the
            numerical value goes beyond the keywords.
