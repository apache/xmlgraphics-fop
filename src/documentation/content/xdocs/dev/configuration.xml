            <title>Configuring FOP</title>
            <p>
In the directory xml-fop/conf you will find an example
configuration file. It contains the default values of various
configurable options available in FOP.
    </p>
    <p>The file fop.xconf is not read automatically, the user
       must specify it on the command line or if embedding then
       configure the appropriate classes.

    <title>Setting up Hyphenation</title>
    <p>Fop comes already with some hyphenation patterns. If you
       need a hyphenation pattern which isn't included in the
       distribution, do the following:
    </p>
    <p>1. get the TeX hyphenation pattern file and turn it into an xml file which conforms
       to the hyphenation.dtd in the sub directory /hyph
    </p>
    <p>2. name this new file following this schema: languageCode_countryCode.xml. If you don't need
       a country code, leave it out, e.g the file name for an American english hyphenation pattern
       would look like this: en_US.xml. For an Italian file: it.xml. Language and country codes must be
       the same as in xsl:fo, that is follow
       <link href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">ISO 639</link>
       and <link href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso3166.txt">ISO 3166</link>
       respectively. NOTE: The ISO 639/ISO 3166 convention is that language names are
       written in lower case, while country codes are written in upper case.
    </p>
    <p>3. If you have build your new hyphenation pattern file
          successfully you put the file into the /hyph directoy
          and rebuild Fop. The file will be picked up and added
          to the fop.jar.
