      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
If the default funtionality of FOP needs to be extended for
some reason then you can write an extensions.
            </p>
            <p>
There are three types of extensions possible. An output document
extensions such as the PDF bookmarks, an instream-foreign-object
extensions such as SVG and an fo extension that creates an
area in the area tree where normal xsl:fo is not possible.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>Default Extensions</title>
            <p>
These extension are available by default. They are automatically loaded
and you only need to provide the correct namespace for your embedded
xml markup.
            </p>
          <section>
            <title>SVG</title>
            <p>
Please see the <link href="svg.html">SVG page</link> for more details.
            </p>
            <p>
The SVG extensions gets all the xml elements in the SVG namespace
and builds an SVG DOM with batik. The SVG DOM is then rendered
to the output format using a handler for the XML content of
the instream-foreign-object.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>PDF Bookmarks</title>
            <p>
To use this standard Fop extension, you need to add a namespace entry for
     http://xml.apache.org/fop/extensions on the root element. </p>

    <p>You can provide outlines inside the root object (but outside
       any page-sequences or
       other formatting objects). Here's an example of an outline entry:</p>
    <source>
<![CDATA[<fo:root xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format"
               xmlns:fox="http://xml.apache.org/fop/extensions">
  <fox:bookmarks>
    <fox:outline internal-destination="sec3">
      <fox:label>Running FOP</fox:label>

      <fox:outline internal-destination="sec3-1">
        <fox:label>Prerequisites</fox:label>
      </fox:outline>
    <fox:outline>
  </fox:bookmarks>
</fo:root>]]></source>
    <p>It works similarly to a basic-link. There is also an external-destination
       property, but it isn't supported currently. The documents
       on the fop-site use this extension so you can see it in action.
            </p>

          </section>
          <section>
            <title>Adding Your Own</title>
            <p>
To add your own extension you need to do the following things.
</p>
<p>
Write code that implements your extension functionality.
There are some examples in the contrib/ directory.
</p>
<p>
Create a jar file with your classes, it must also include the
following file "/META-INF/services/org.apache.fop.fo.ElementMapping".
In this file you need to put the fully qualified classname of
your element mappings class. This class must implement the
"org.apache.fop.fo.ElementMapping" interface.
</p>
<p>
Create your fo file with the extra xml data embedded in the file
with the correct name space. The pdf documents on the fob site
use this extension, see <link href="examples.html">Examples</link>
for more examples.
</p>
<p>
Put your jar file in the classpath and then run fop over the fo file.
