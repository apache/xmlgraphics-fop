      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>These pages contain information that should be helpful for those developing FOP.
This certainly includes programmers, but may also include those contributing to the project in other ways.</p>
      <p>For basic and user information on FOP, please visit the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop">FOP homepage</link>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="lines">
      <title>Development Lines</title>
      <p>There are currently three lines of development on the FOP product:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The oldest is the one that releases are currently generated from, and is also called the "maintenance branch". Because of limitations in its design, the FOP committers decided to freeze new development on this branch, and are providing only bug fixes. This branch is tagged as "fop-0_20_2-maintain" in the CVS repository.</li>
        <li>The main development line is the future of FOP. It was spawned from the "maintenance" branch, but had to quickly be "broken" so that the needed redesign could be dropped into place. It is currently not as mature as the "maintenance" branch, but has far greater long-term prospects. It is also known as the "root" or "trunk" or "redesign".</li>
        <li>The "Alt Design" is exactly that: an alternative design approach. Because its efforts are largely complementary and parallel to the main development branch, and because it is expected to be merged at some point into the trunk, it is <link href="../design/alt.design/index.html">documented separately</link>. The authors of this effort are currently in the process of merging their work into the trunk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that patches for enhancements to the maintenance branch will generally not be considered. Bug fixes are welcome there, but new developers are strongly encouraged to apply their efforts to the trunk development line.</p>
      <p>Because there is a fair amount of common information between the maintenance and trunk development lines, we attempt to document them together, highlighting differences only where needed.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Getting Involved</title>
      <p>Review the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/roles.html">Apache Project Roles and Responsibilities</link> document for an understanding of the various roles of contributors within the community.</p>
      <p>There are many different ways that you can help with FOP development.
The development of FOP and the related plans and tasks are discussed on the dev mailing list.
Users can help or get issues resolved by contributing information and examples to the developers.
      </p>
      <section>
        <title>Get familiar with the FOP-related standards</title>
        <p>At the moment FOP is mainly a tool to render XSL-FO files to pdf. Therefore if you want to contribute to FOP you should become familiar with these standards. You can find links at <link href="../resources.html#specs">Specifications</link>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>FOP's Design</title>
        <p>The design for FOP is specified under the <link href="../design/index.html">Design</link> section. This is where the information on how FOP is developed and designed
internally will be kept.
    </p>

      <section>
        <title>Subscribe to the fop developers list</title>
        <p>You can subscribe to fop-dev@xml.apache.org by sending an email
        to <link href="mailto:fop-dev-subscribe@xml.apache.org">fop-dev-subscribe@xml.apache.org</link>
        </p>
        <p>Sending bug reports and feature requests to the list is a welcome and important contribution to
     developing FOP.  </p>
        <p>Read also the <link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fop-dev&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">archive</link>
     of the discussion list fop-dev to get an idea of the issues being discussed. </p>

      <section>
        <title>Look at the developer's code using cvs</title>
        <p>Between releases the newest code can be accessed via cvs. To do this you need to install a cvs
     client on your computer, if it is not already there. An explanation how to connect to the
     FOP source repository can be found at <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cvs.html">http://xml.apache.org/cvs.html</link>.
     An introduction into cvs and the cvs manual can be found in the
     <link href="http://xml.apache.org/library.html">reference library</link>.</p>
        <p>All changes to the code repository are sent to a special mailing list. After a cvs commit the diffs are automatically sent to this list. You can subscribe
     to fop-cvs@xml.apache.org by sending an email to <link href="mailto:fop-cvs-subscribe@xml.apache.org">
     fop-cvs-subscribe@xml.apache.org</link>. If you want to contribute to the development of FOP you should subscribe,
     because it is important that you follow changes being made. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="patches">
        <title>Submitting Patches</title>
        <p>If you have useful changes to source code (bugfixes or enhancements), test files, or documentation that you would like to contribute to the project, please do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your changes include source code, make sure that it does not break FOP (i.e. make sure that FOP still compiles with your changes).</li>
          <li>If your changes include test files, review the <link href="testing.html">Testing page</link>.</li>
          <li><link href="tools.html#cvs_patch">Create a patch file</link> for the differences to be applied to the existing code.</li>
          <li><link href="../bugs.html#issues_new">Create a new bugzilla issue</link> for the patch. Include the text "[PATCH]" at the beginning of the description. Attach the patch file to the issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of the committers will test your patch and consider its implications for the project. They will then either commit it to the repository or explain on the issue why they did not. Depending on the work load and skill-sets of the various committers, it may take some time before a a submitted patch is addressed.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Coding Conventions</title>
        <p>As mentioned in <link href="http://xml.apache.org/source.html">Apache XML Project Guidelines</link>,
  <strong>all Java Language source code in the repository must be written in conformance to the</strong>
          <link href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Code Conventions
  for the Java Programming Language</link> as published by Sun. Additionally we agreed on 4
  spaces (no tabs) for indenting.</p>
        <p>If you don't like those conventions, just use your own standards while developing and reformat the source before
  committing with a tool like <link href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">astyle</link> (Artistic Style).
