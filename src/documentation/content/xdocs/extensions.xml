Sometimes it is desirable to have extensions to XSL-FO in order to support
some feature of the output format which isn't covered by the XSL-FO
specification.
    </p>
    <section>
      <title>Default Extensions</title>
      <p>
These extension are available by default. They are automatically loaded
and you only need to provide the correct namespace for your embedded
XML markup.

To use this standard FOP extension, you need to add a namespace entry for
http://xml.apache.org/fop/extensions on the root element.
        </p>
        <p>
You can provide outlines inside the root object (but outside any
page-sequences or other formatting objects). Here's an example of an outline
entry:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[<fo:root xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format"
               xmlns:fox="http://xml.apache.org/fop/extensions">
  <fox:outline internal-destination="sec3">
    <fox:label>Running FOP</fox:label>

    <fox:outline internal-destination="sec3-1">
      <fox:label>Prerequisites</fox:label>
    </fox:outline>
  <fox:outline>
</fo:root>]]></source>
        <p>
It works similarly to a basic-link. There is also an external-destination
property, but it isn't supported currently. See the pdfoutline.fo file in
examples/fo/basic for a more complete example.

      <title>Adding Your Own</title>
        <p>
To add your own extension you need to do the following things.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Write code that implements your extension functionality. The easiest place to
start is by looking at the code in org.apache.fop.extension.
          </li>
          <li>
Create a jar file with your classes, it must also include the following file
"/META-INF/services/org.apache.fop.fo.ElementMapping". In this file you need
to put the fully qualified classname of your element mappings class. This
class must implement the "org.apache.fop.fo.ElementMapping" interface.
          </li>
          <li>
Create your XSL-FO file with the extra XML data embedded in the file with the
correct name space. The examples for SVG and pdfoutline.fo show how this can
be done.
          </li>
          <li>
Put your jar file in the classpath and then run fop over the XSL-FO file.
          </li>
        </ol>
