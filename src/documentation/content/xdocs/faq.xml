    <faq id="fop-general">
      <question>What is Apache™ FOP?</question>
      <answer>
      <p>
        FOP is a print formatter for <link href="#xslfo">XSL formatting
        objects</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be used to render an XML file containing XSL formatting objects
        into a page layout. The main target is PDF but other rendering targets
        are supported, such as AWT, PCL, text and direct printing.

      <question>What can I do with FOP?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          FOP provides both an application and a library that converts an XSL FO
          document into paginated output.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FOP command line application can be directly used to transform XML
          into PDF, PostScript, PCL and other formats, there is also an AWT
          based viewer integrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The library can be used in servlets and other Java applications.

      <question>What is XSL?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          XSL is a W3C standard concerned with publishing XML documents. It
          consists of two parts: <link href="#XSLT">XSLT</link> and <link
          href="#xslfo">XSL-FO</link>. The acronym expands to
          e<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>S</strong>tylesheet
          <strong>L</strong>anguage.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </faq>
    <faq id="xslfo">
      <question>What is XSL-FO?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          XSLFO (aka XSL-FO) is an XML vocabulary, defined by W3C Recommendation
          <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/">Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)
          Version 1.1</link>, that is used to specify a pagination and
          other styling for page layout output. The acronym &#8220;FO&#8221;
          stands for
          <strong>F</strong>ormatting <strong>O</strong>bjects. XSLFO can be
          used in conjunction with <link href="#XSLT">XSLT</link> to convert
          from any XML format into a paginated layout ready for printing or
          displaying.
        </p>
        <p>
          XSLFO defines a set of elements in XML that describes the way pages
          are set up. The contents of the pages are filled from flows. There can
          be static flows that appear on every page (for headers and footers)
          and the main flow which fills the body of the page.

    <faq id="XSLT">
      <question>What is XSLT?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          XSLT describes the transformation of arbitrary XML input into other
          XML (like XSLFO), HTML or plain text. The &#8220;T&#8221; comes from
          <strong>T</strong>ransformation. For historical reasons, a
          transformation is often also called a &#8220;style sheet&#8221;.

    <faq id="NoClassDefFound">
      <question>I get a NoClassDefFound exception.</question>
      <answer>
        <p>This is typically a problem with your classpath.</p>
        <p>If you are running FOP from the command line:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the command file <code>fop.bat</code>, <code>fop.cmd</code> or <code>fop.js</code> on MS Windows, or <code>fop</code> on Unix/Linux from the FOP
            distribution. 
          </li>
          <li>
            If this doesn't help, check whether still all the jar files
            mentioned in the classpath in the <code>fop.bat</code> file are in their
            respective places.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you run FOP embedded in your servlet, web application or
          other Java application, check the classpath of the
          application. Check the also the information pertaining to <link
          href="1.0/servlets.html#servlet-engine">servlet engines</link>
          for further hints.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you downloaded the source distribution, or a snapshop
          from the repository, remember you have to build the FOP jars
          first.

    <faq id="NoSuchMethodException">
      <question>I get a NoSuchMethodException or a NoSuchFieldException
      exception.</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This is usually caused by an older version of one of the FOP jars or
          old XML tools in the classpath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incompatible versions of Batik may also cause this problem. Use the
          version of Batik that comes with FOP. It is not always possible to
          use a more recent version of Batik.

      <question>I get a MalformedURLException.</question>
      <answer>
        <anchor id="MalformedURL"/>
        <p>
          What you probably think of as "file names" are usually URLs, in
          particular the <code>src</code> attribute of fo:external-graphic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because usage of URLs is growing, you should make yourself familiar
          with it. The relevant specification is <link
          href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a nutshell, the correct syntax for an absolute file URL is
          <code>file:///some/path/file.ext</code> on Unix and
          <code>file:///z:/some/path/file.ext</code> on Windows systems. Note
          the triple slash, and also that only forward slashes are used, even on
          windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          A relative file URL starts with anything but a slash, and doesn't have
          the <code>file:</code> prefix, for example <code>file.ext</code>,
          <code>path/file.ext</code> or <code>../file.ext</code>. The string
          <code>file:path/file.ext</code> is <em>not</em> a relative URL,
          in fact, it isn't a valid URL at all since the <code>file</code>
          scheme does not (officially) support relative paths. A relative URL
          is subject to a resolving process, which transforms it into an absolute
          URL.

    <faq id="fop-hangs">
      <question>FOP hangs. FOP does not exit.</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The most likely reason is a known problem with the Java run time
          environment which is triggered by rendering SVGs. Sun's JDK 1.4 and
          later do not have this problem. See also <link href="#svghangs">FOP
          does not exit if a SVG is included</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another possibility is that FOP went into a non terminating
          loop. Usually this is indicated by lots of log messages of the form
          "[INFO]: [NNNN]" which indicate a new page has been started or <link
          href="#boxoverflow">box overflows</link>. After some time, FOP will
          crash with an OutOfMemoryException.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you called the FOP command line application from some other
          program, for example from Java using Runtime.exec(), it may hang
          while trying to write log entries to the output pipe. You have to read
          the FOP output regularly to empty the pipe buffer. It is best to avoid
          exec'ing FOP, use the library interface instead.

        <p>
          If you used a relative URL, make sure your application has the working

          The full exception usually looks similar to this:

          This exception is usually a follow-up error after another exception. Sometimes

      <answer>
        <p>
          This message is a warning that FOP failed to read from the Font cache.
          Which means any Font auto detection or Font directories will be re-scanned.
          So this failure doesn't break anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid the warning you can simply delete the

    <title>Problems with FOP output</title>
    <faq id="leader-expansion">
      <question>Leaders don't work in current FOP. Instead of
      filling the line, only three dots or a short ruler is
      output.</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Leaders still work, in fact they work better than ever
          before. You'll just have to add <code>text-align="justify"</code> and/or
          <code>text-align-last="justify"</code> to the block with the leader. Be
          sure you haven't accidentally overridden the
          <code>leader-length.maximum="100%"</code> default value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier versions of FOP used to expand a leader to fill the
          rest of the line unconditionally, anything following it,
          like page numbers in a TOC, was actually shifted beyond the
          right margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new implementation uses leader-length.optimum to
          determine where to break the line, and expands the leader
          only further if the line should be filled, as indicated by
          the text-align and text-align-last properties.

          Actually due to the fuzzyness of the specification both the
          old and the new method are conformant (although adding text
          after the expanded leader in the old variant never was).
        </p>

          If you want to have a longer ruler or space in a

      <answer>
        <p>
          This is because spec conformance has been improved.

          The <link
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#force-page-count">force-page-count
          property</link> controls how a FO processor pads page sequences in
          order to get certain page counts or last page numbers. The default is
          "<code>auto</code>". With this setting, if the next page sequence
          begins with an odd page number because you set the
          initial-page-number, and the current page sequence also ends with an
          odd page number, the processor inserts a blank page to keep odd and
          even page numbers alternating (similar for the case the current page
          sequence ends with an even page number and the next page sequence
          starts with an even page number).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't want to have this blank page, use
          <code>force-page-count="no-force"</code>.

        <p>Most commonly, the external file is not being found by FOP.
Check the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Empty or wrong baseDir setting.</li>
          <li>Spelling errors in the file name (including using the wrong case).</li>
          <li>Security Problems (i.e. the image could not be accessed
          because FOP is not allowed to read the file). This is
          especially a problem if the external file is retrieved over
          HTTP. Possible issues include security settings on the

      <answer>
        <p>
          Since the <code>overflow</code> property doesn't apply to table-cell, you
          can wrap the cell content in a block-container and specify
          <code>overflow="hidden"</code> there. Alternatively,
          if you have long words overflowing table cells, try to
          get them hyphenated. Artificial names like product identifications or
          long numbers usually aren't hyphenated. You can try special processing
          at XSLT level, like
        </p>

    <faq id="row-height-constraint">
      <question>FOP tells me: "The contents of row 1 are taller than they should be".
        What does that mean?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This is usually caused by setting a "height" on a table-row or table-cell and when
          the content is higher than the specified height. By setting "height" (a so-called
          corresponding property) you
          <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#d0e4413">implicitely set</link>
          block-progression-dimension.minimum, block-progression-dimension.optimum and
          block-progression-dimension.maximum to the same value. You'll get some information
          about that in the warning message. Look for something like:
          "MinOptMax[min=opt=max=14000]".
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming you set the height on the table-row to 14pt and your content is 75pt high,
          a constraint (maximum=14pt) is violated. Normally, you just want to make sure
          with the "height" property that the row has a minimum height. If that is so, the
          right solution is to specify block-progression-dimension.minimum="14pt" instead of
          height="14pt".

      <answer>
        <p>
          No, although you might easily think so. The problem has to do
          with property inheritance of the start-indent and end-indent
          properties to which the margin properties are mapped. Apache
          FOP strictly adheres to the XSL-FO specification here which many
          other commercial FO implementations don't do to better meet end-user
          expectations. You can make FOP behave like these if you set
          <code>setBreakIndentInheritanceOnReferenceAreaBoundary(true)</code>
          on the FOUserAgent. The better way is to reset <code>start-indent</code>
          and <code>end-indent</code> to "0pt" on table-body or block-container.

    <faq id="pdf-ps-java2d-differences">
      <question>Why is the output of Java2D/AWT-based renderers different than, for example, PDF or PS?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          If you render the same document once to a PNG or TIFF and once into a PDF, the output
          may not be the same, i.e. line breaks are different or lines may have different heights.
          The reason for this: The Java2D-based renderers use the font subsystem of Java2D/AWT. The
          PDF and PS renderers use FOP's own font subsystem which provides much better font metrics
          than Java2D. These can lead to different layout decisions when the same document is
          rendered with different renderers. An alternative approach to fix this problem might be
          available but it hasn't been tested, yet. See also the

      <question>I have problems with SVG referring to gradients etc. using

      <answer>
        <p>
          This is really a "resolving relative URI" problem with some
          twists. The problem is that the <code>#stuff</code> URL fragment
          identifier is resolved within the current SVG document. So the
          reference must be valid within the XML subset and it cannot
          reference other SVG documents in the same XML file. Some options
          to try:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Put the SVG into a separate file and use it with
            fo:external-graphics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a separate SVG file which contains only the gradient (and
            perhaps other SVG stuff you want to reference) and point an absolute
            URL to it:
            <code>fill="url(file:///c:/refstuff/grad.svg#PurpleToWhite)"</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Same as above but use a relative URL:
            <code>fill="url(grad.svg#PurpleToWhite)"</code>. This may be easier
            to deploy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that the reference is valid in the current SVG document.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In any case, the referenced stuff has to be pointed to by an URL. It
          doesn't necessarily have to be a file URL, HTTP should also
          work. Also, expect a performance hit in all cases, because another XML
          file has to be retrieved and parsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, both FOP and especially Batik should be fixed to make
          your code work as expected, but this will not only take some time
          but also some effort by a standard committee in order to make the
          semantics of this kind of references in embedded SVG clearer.

        <p>
          This phenomenon is not a
          bug in FOP, but rather in the dependent packages: Apache Batik, Apache Xalan-J and SAXON. The bug in Apache Batik will be
          fixed in the next release. In the latest release of Apache Xalan-J, the bug is already fixed. It only occurs in the Xalan
          version bundled with Sun's JVM, because Sun uses a rather old version.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bug description: In a namespace-enabled Level 3 DOM, an attribute in the default namespace must be set with
          <code>"null"</code> as the value for the namespace URI. SAX, on the other side, uses an empty string ("") to designate
          the default namespace. Many packages appear to not properly handle this difference in which case they still use the empty
          string as the namespace URI parameter for <code>org.w3c.dom.Element.setAttributeNS()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Work-around: Use the latest version of Apache Xalan-J. Note that starting with JDK 1.4 it's not enough to replace Xalan-J

      <question>Some characters are not displayed, or displayed incorrectly, or
      displayed as &#8220;#&#8221;.</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This usually means the selected font doesn't have a glyph
          for the character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard text fonts supplied with Acrobat Reader have
          mostly glyphs for characters from the ISO Latin 1 character
          set. For a variety of reasons, even those are not completely
          guaranteed to work, for example you can't use the fi
          ligature from the standard serif font. Check the <link
          href="1.0/output.html#pdf-fonts">overview</link> for the default
          PDF fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use your own fonts, the font must have a glyph for
          the desired character. Furthermore the font must be
          available on the machine where the PDF is viewed or it must
          have been embedded in the PDF file. See <link
          href="1.0/fonts.html">embedding fonts</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most symbols, it is better to select the symbol font
          explicitely, for example in order to get the symbol for the
          mathematical empty set, write:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[<fo:inline font-family="Symbol">&#x2205;</fo:inline>]]></source>
        <p>
          The "#" shows up if the selected font does not define a glyph for the
          required character, for example if you try:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[<fo:inline font-family="Helvetica">&#x2205;</fo:inline>]]></source>

      <answer>
        <p>
          Check the paper size in Acrobat settings and the "fit to page" print
          setting. Contorted printing is often caused by a mismatched paper
          format, for example if the setting is "US Letter" but the PDF was
          made for A4. Sometimes also the printer driver interferes, check its
          settings too.

    <faq id="acrobat-anti-aliasing">
      <question>How can I get rid of strange single-pixel lines inside table borders or between table cells in Adobe Acrobat?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Since Apache FOP supports the collapsed border model, every border segment consists
          of two separate shapes. This is due to the fact that each side of the border
          segment can have a different color. Now, Adobe Acrobat may display thin (1 pixel wide)
          lines inside the border segment or sometimes even between to adjacent
          colored rectangles making up the background of a block or table cell.
          This effect is due to the way Adobe Acrobat does anti-aliasing. Adobe's algorithm
          seems to cause these artifacts. Other PDF viewers don't have that problem. Or at least
          we haven't had any reports in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, these artifacts do not appear in print since no anti-aliasing is done
          by Adobe Acrobat in this case (except maybe if you tell Acrobat to print the page
          as a bitmap in which case Adobe fully composes the page itself). So, if the artifacts appear
          on screen, it doesn't mean they have to appear in print, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get rid of the artifacts, you can call up the "Preferences" dialog of
          Adobe Acrobat and select the tab "Page display". Enabling "Enhance thin lines"
          may help in some situations. Otherwise, you can disable "Smooth line art".
          You may have to disable "Use 2D graphics acceleration", too, so you can disable
          "Smooth line art" in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here an example of how the effect can look like (left: anti-aliasing on, right: anti-aliasing off):
        </p>
        <figure src="images/acrobat-anti-aliasing-artifacts.png" alt="Left: anti-aliasing on, Right: off"/>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, it is not possible to control the above settings from within the PDF file.
          The user has to change these settings himself. Improving FOP to avoid this kind of problem
          would be possible although rather hard to achieve because we'd need to add a considerable
          amount of code to combine the various line segments. Something like that has been tried already
          years ago showing that this is a tricky task. Also, the improvement may not justify the amount
          of effort required.

          It depends whether you mean "printing to a printer under control of
          the server" or "printing on the client's printer".
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first problem, look at the print servlet in the FOP
          examples. You'll have to gather any printer settings in a HTML form
          and send it to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the second task, you can use some client side script to start
          Acrobat Reader in print mode, or use a Java applet based on the FOP
          print servlet. This depends heavily on the client installation and
          should not be relied on except in tightly controlled environments.

      <answer>
        <p>
          You will get better results if you transform your source
          XML directly into XSLFO. It is tempting to use the
          XML-&gt;XHTML-&gt;XSLFO approach, because this apparently means
          there's only one transformation to maintain, but XHTML
          and publishing grade PDF are dissimilar enough that an
          "generic" XHTML-&gt;XSLFO(PDF) usually wont cut it, because
          the XHTML already lacks information from the original XML.
          It may be worthwhile to go from the source XML to an
          intermediate custom XML which on one hand is close enough
          to representation to allow simple transformation to either
          XHTML or XSLFO for most of the structure, but on the other
          hand retains enough semantic from the original XML that
          elements which must be handled differently in the two
          representations can be handled differently. Setting this
          up requires experience and most likely extensive prototyping.
