    <ul>
      <li><a href="../bugs.html">the bug list in Bugzilla</a></li>

  </note>
  <p>
    Apache™ FOP has an extensive automated testing infrastructure. Parts of this infrastructure are several
    sets of test cases. When a test case is listed in disabled-testcases.xml it is disabled in the JUnit 
    tests during the normal build process. This indicates a problem in the current codebase. When a bug is 
    fixed or a missing feature is added the entry for the relevant test case(s) are removed.
