    <title>Getting Help</title>
    <subtitle>Checklist for Finding Appropriate Resources</subtitle>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>The FOP developer community is eager to help you maximize the usefulness of FOP.
However, to make wise use of its limited resources, support must be primarily self-service.
Go through the following checklist sequentially to determine what kind of help you need,
and where to get it:</p>
    <section>
      <title>Understand Underlying Technologies</title>
      <p>If you have a questions about XML, XSLT, or XSL-FO that are not directly related to FOP, please consult resources that are appropriate for those questions.
FOP is an implementation of these technologies, and when you use FOP, there is a presumption that you have a working understanding of them.
We have included several useful links on our <link href="resources.html">Resources</link> page that may help you get started.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Review FOP's Standards Compliance</title>
      <p>FOP is a work in progress, and does not yet fully comply with the W3C XSL-FO standard.
The developers track which standard requirements have been implemented, and have documented these capabilities on the <link href="compliance.html">Compliance</link> page.
If this document appears to be in error, continue down this checklist so that either the document or the software can be corrected.
Otherwise, please do not submit mailing list questions or bug reports regarding features documented in the standard.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Read the Documentation</title>
      <p>Review the documentation pages on this site.
There is information about how to run FOP, how to embed it, how to add custom fonts etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Check the FAQs</title>
      <p>Consult the <link href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</link> to see if your question has already been answered.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Review FOP User Mailing List Archive</title>
      <p>It is possible that your question has already been answered but has not yet found its way into the FAQ.
Links to the FOP User mailing list archives are on the <link href="resources.html#mailing-lists-fop-user">Resources</link> page.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Look for an Existing Issue Report</title>
      <p>See <link href="bugs.html#issues_existing">Reported Issues</link> for instructions on how to use the list of open issues. Review these open issues to see if any match your concerns.
If so, please do not post a mailing list question or report another issue, as these will only slow the development team down.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Submit Question to FOP User Mailing List</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscription information is on the <link href="resources.html#mailing-lists-fop-user">Resources</link> page.</li>
        <li>Review <link href="resources.html#mailing-lists-general">General Mailing List Information</link> before submitting your question.</li>
        <li>State the version of FOP you're using.</li>
        <li>Include detailed error messages, if there are any.</li>
        <li>Provide FO code instead of XSLT snippets or DocBook source. 
See <link href="running.html#running_xalan">Running Xalan</link> for how to produce FO from your XML+XSLT.</li>
        <li>Provide the shortest possible complete, <strong>self-contained</strong> FO code that demonstrates the problem.
Include images only if they are an integral part of the question.
Filter out any confidential material.</li>
        <li>Include only those portions of stack traces that will be helpful in finding the problem.</li>
        <li>Instead of attaching large PDF files or screen shots, include a small B&amp;W GIF, JPG or PNG of the area of interest.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Enter an Issue Report</title>
      <p>If, and only if, you have followed all of the above steps, and believe that there is a bug or needed feature that you would like to report, please enter an issue in Bugzilla. Never use Bugzilla to post questions, only to enter issues that have already been asked on the user mailing list.</p>
      <p>See <link href="bugs.html#issues_new">Reporting New Issues</link> for detailed instructions on how to enter an issue.
      </p>

    <section>
      <title>Find Out How <em>You</em> Can Help</title>
    </section>
    <p>As stated above, the FOP development team is a limited resource. Most make their livings doing things other than writing and supporting FOP. Perhaps you need a feature from the XSL-FO standard to be implemented right away, or a bug fixed, or a new output format, or .... If so, there are several ways that you can help:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Become a <link href="dev/index.html">FOP developer</link>.</li>
      <li>Fund a developer (or part of one). There is usually at least one FOP developer who would be glad to devote more time to FOP development if funding were in place.</li>
      <li>Help out on the user mailing list. Users giving good answers to other users allows developers to focus more on development and less on support.</li>
    </ul>
