      <title>Binary or Source?</title>
      <p>
        Most FOP users will want to download the latest binary distribution, 
        which is ready to run "out of the box." However, a source distribution 
        will be preferable if you fall into one of the following categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You wish to modify FOP.
        </li>
        <li>
          You wish to use a version more recent than the latest release. For 
          example, if you have read on the user mailing list that a bug has 
          been fixed or a feature added that you are eager to try, you might 
          download a source distribution from the CVS repository so that you 
          don't have to wait for the next release.
        </li>
        <li>
          You wish to build a local copy of the API documentation (javadocs).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="binary">
      <title>Binary Download</title>
      <p>
        Binary distributions include "-bin" in their names, and can be downloaded from a
        <link href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop">FOP Distribution mirror</link>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="source">
      <title>Source Download</title>
      <p>
        You must first determine which of the two main development branches you wish 
        to download, "maintenance" or "redesign". See 
        <link href="dev/index.html">Development Introduction</link> for more details 
        on the choices, and for the CVS tags to use when downloading the "maintenance" 
        branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several ways to obtain a source distribution. Please note that they 
        are listed from least current to most current:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Download a released version from a 
          <link href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xml/fop">FOP Distribution mirror</link>.
          Source distributions include "-src" in their names. Please note that official 
          releases currently are <em>only</em> made from the "maintenance" branch.
        </li>
        <!--li>
          Download a CVS snapshot from the cvs files 
          <link href="http://xml.apache.org/from-cvs/xml-fop/">here</link>. 
          These snapshots are built approximately every six hours, and have the GMT of 
          their creation time embedded in their names. Please note that CVS snapshots 
          are made only for the "redesign" branch.
        </li-->
        <li>
          Download directly from the SVN repository.
          Anyone can do this using the 
          <link href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/repo.html">Anonymous SVN Server</link>.
          By default, the code in SVN is up-to-the-minute, the same code that the developers 
          are modifying. See the <link href="dev/tools.html#svn">SVN section of Developer Tools</link>
          for more information on using SVN.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With any source distribution, you will need to 
        build FOP from the source files. For details please see the "Build" page on the documentation tab
        for the version you've downloaded.
