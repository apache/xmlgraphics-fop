In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters 
were all beautiful; and the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which

castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well,

down by the side of the cool fountain; and when she was bored she took a golden ball,
