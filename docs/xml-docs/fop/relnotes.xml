<s1 title="FOP 0.20.4">
  <p>Important changes since 0.20.3:
    <ul>
       <li>FOP should now work with any JAXP1.1 compliant parser/transformer. 
         It has been successfully tested with Xerces/Xalan, Saxon and JDK1.4 
         (which includes Crimson and Xalan).
       </li>
       <li>The following JARs have been updated: 
         Xerces to version 2.0.1, Xalan to version 2.3.1 and Batik to version 1.5beta2.
      </li>
      <li>Fop has been compiled with Jimi support this time
        but you still have to download
        <jump href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">Jimi</jump>
        and copy it to lib/ to get PNG support (no need to build FOP yourself though).
      </li>
      <li>Building FOP with JDK1.2 does not work. Running is ok except
        support for additional truetype fonts in AWT Viewer.
      </li>
      <li>Logging has been changed from LogKit to Avalon's Logger Interface.
        (see <jump href="embedding.html">Embedding</jump> for details).
      </li>
      <li>Building under JDK 1.4:
         You need to add a method in
         <code>src/org/apache/fop/svg/PDFGraphics2D.java</code>
         (search for jdk1.4 and remove the comments)
      </li>
      <li>To decrease the size of the distributions, ant, xml-docs, design-docs
        and the hyphenation sources have been removed from the binary distribution.
        Javadocs have been removed from the source distribution (use
        <code>build javadocs</code> to generate them).
      </li>
      <li>Documentaion generation is broken in the maintenance branch at the moment
       (Stylebook needs xerces1). The docs for this release are generated from the trunk. 
      </li>
      <li>
        For a more detailed list of changes, see the CHANGES file in the root of the FOP distribution.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
