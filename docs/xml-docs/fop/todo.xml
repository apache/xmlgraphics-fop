  <s2 title="Core Features">
<s3 title="Layout">

    <p>
Need to improve the website to better demonstrate what fop is and
can do. Examples, screenshots, pdf documents.
    </p>
</s3>
<s3 title="Property Support">
    <p>
Currently all properties are in the xml file. We need to handle all default
values properly (including ones that change depending on the element) and
all possible values.
    </p>
    <p>
To see if a property is implemented then look in the src/codegen/foproperties.xml file.
    </p>
    <p>
To see if a particular element uses this property then look in the element code. This is generally found in the package org.apache.fop.fo.flow.*.
    </p>
</s3>
<s3 title="Property Resolution">
    <p>
This is support for the functions in property values that evaluate some
expression.
Better support for resolution including support for "inherit" and values
with lists.
    </p>
</s3>
<s3 title="Validity Checking">
    <p>
Check the validity of children for a particular element to ensure
there are no invalid children. Should help process the layout better.
    </p>
</s3>
</s2>
  <s2 title="Processing Improvements">

<s3 title="user agent">

A user agent (or some similar thing) is needed to handle adjustable
