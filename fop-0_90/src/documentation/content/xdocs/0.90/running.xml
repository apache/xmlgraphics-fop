      <p>The following software must be installed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java 1.3.x or later Runtime Environment.</li>
        <li>
          Apache FOP. The <a href="../download.html">FOP distribution</a> includes all libraries that you will 
          need to run a basic FOP installation. These can be found in the [fop-root]/lib directory. These 
          libraries include the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A JAXP-compatible XML Parser (FOP comes with <a class="fork" href="ext:xerces">Apache Xerces-J</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              A JAXP-compatible XSLT Processor (FOP comes with <a class="fork" href="ext:xalan">Apache Xalan-J</a>).

      <p>The following software is optional, depending on your needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Graphics libraries. Support for some graphics formats requires additional packages. See

        <p>
          Basic FOP installation consists of first unzipping the <code>.gz</code> file that is the 
          distribution medium, then unarchiving the resulting <code>.tar</code> file in a 
          directory/folder that is convenient on your system. Please consult your operating system 
          documentation or Zip application software documentation for instructions specific to your 
          site.

        <title>Problems</title>
        <p>
          Some Mac OSX users have experienced filename truncation problems using Stuffit to unzip 
          and unarchive their distribution media. This is a legacy of older Mac operating systems, 
          which had a 31-character pathname limit. Several Mac OSX users have recommended that 
          Mac OSX users use the shell command <code>tar -xzf</code> instead.

      <title>Starting FOP as a Standalone Application</title>
      <p>
        The usual and recommended practice for starting FOP from the command line is to run the 
        batch file fop.bat (Windows) or the shell script fop (Unix/Linux).
        If you write your own scripts, be sure to review these standard scripts to make sure that 
        you get your environment properly configured.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard scripts for starting FOP require that the environment variable JAVA_HOME be 
        set to a path pointing to the appropriate Java installation on your system. Macintosh OSX 
        includes a Java environment as part of its distribution. We are told by Mac OSX users that 
        the path to use in this case is <code>/Library/Java/Home</code>. <strong>Caveat:</strong>
        We suspect that, as Apple releases new Java environments and as FOP upgrades the minimum 
        Java requirements, the two will inevitably not match on some systems. Please see 
        <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/faq">Java on Mac OSX FAQ</a> for information as 
        it becomes available.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an alternative to the start scripts you can run "java -jar build/fop.jar" in which case
        FOP tries to build the classpath for running FOP dynamically. Please note, that this might
        not always work as expected.

      <p>
        PDF encryption is only available if FOP was compiled with encryption support 
        <strong>and</strong> if compatible encryption support is availabe at run time. 
        Currently, only the JCE is supported. Check the <a href="pdfencryption.html">Details</a>.

    <section id="check-input">
      <title>Using Xalan to Check XSL-FO Input</title>
      <p>
        FOP sessions that use -xml and -xsl input instead of -fo input are actually 
        controlling two distinct conversions: Tranforming XML to XSL-FO, then formatting 
        the XSL-FO to PDF (or another FOP output format).
        Although FOP controls both of these processes, the first is included merely as 
        a convenience and for performance reasons.
        Only the second is part of FOP's core processing.
        If a user has a problem running FOP, it is important to determine which of these 
        two processes is causing the problem.
        If the problem is in the first process, the user's stylesheet is likely the cause.
        The FOP development team does not have resources to help with stylesheet issues, 
        although we have included links to some useful 
        <a href="../resources.html#specs">Specifications</a> and 
        <a href="../resources.html#articles">Books/Articles</a>.
        If the problem is in the second process, FOP may have a bug or an unimplemented 
        feature that does require attention from the FOP development team.
      </p>
      <note>The user is always responsible to provide correct XSL-FO code to FOP.</note>
      <p>
        In the case of using -xml and -xsl input, although the user is responsible for 
        the XSL-FO code that is FOP's input, it is not visible to the user. To make the 
        intermediate FO file visible, the FOP distribution includes the "-foout" option 
        which causes FOP to run only the first (transformation) step, and write the 
        results to a file. (See also the Xalan command-line below)
      </p>
      <note>
        When asking for help on the FOP mailing lists, <em>never</em> attach XML and 
        XSL to illustrate the issue. Always run the XSLT step (-foout) and send the 
        resulting XSL-FO file instead. Of course, be sure that the XSL-FO file is 
        correct before sending it.
      </note>
      <p>
        The -foout option works the same way as if you would call the 
        <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/commandline.html">Xalan command-line</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>java org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -IN xmlfile -XSL file -OUT outfile</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that there are some subtle differences between the FOP and Xalan command-lines.

    <section id="memory">
      <title>Memory Usage</title>
      <p>
        FOP can consume quite a bit of memory, even though this has been continually improved.
        This is partly inherent to the formatting process and partly caused by implementation choices.
        All FO processors currently on the market have memory problems with certain layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are running out of memory when using FOP, here are some ideas that may help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Increase memory available to the JVM. See 
          <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html">the -Xmx option</a> 
          for more information.
          <warning>
            It is usually unwise to increase the memory allocated to the JVM beyond the amount of 
            physical RAM, as this will generally cause significantly slower performance.
          </warning>
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid forward references.
          Forward references are references to some later part of a document.
          Examples include page number citations which refer to pages which follow the citation, 
          tables of contents at the beginning of a document, and page numbering schemes that 
          include the total number of pages in the document 
          (<a href="../faq.html#pagenum">"page N of TOTAL"</a>).
          Forward references cause all subsequent pages to be held in memory until the reference 
          can be resolved, i.e. until the page with the referenced element is encountered.
          Forward references may be required by the task, but if you are getting a memory 
          overflow, at least consider the possibility of eliminating them.
          A table of contents could be replaced by PDF bookmarks instead or moved to the end of 
          the document (reshuffle the paper could after printing).
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid large images, especially if they are scaled down.
          If they need to be scaled, scale them in another application upstream from FOP.
          For many image formats, memory consumption is driven mainly by the size of the image 
          file itself, not its dimensions (width*height), so increasing the compression rate 
          may help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use multiple page sequences.
          FOP starts rendering after the end of a page sequence is encountered.
          While the actual rendering is done page-by-page, some additional memory is 
          freed after the page sequence has been rendered.
          This can be substantial if the page sequence contains lots of FO elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of FOP's stated design goals is to be able to process input of arbitrary size.
        Addressing this goal is one of the prime motivations behind the 
        <a href="../dev/index.html">FOP Redesign</a>.
