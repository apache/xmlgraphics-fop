**** THINGS TO DO **** 

Support XSL Candidate Release 

first target is basic conformance 

1.One category of tasks will be to implement missing formatting objects. 

basic
  fo:declarations
  fo:multi-case 
  fo:table-and-caption 
  fo:wrapper 

extended
  fo:bidi-override 
  fo:color-profile
  fo:float 
  fo:footnote 
  fo:footnote-body
  fo:initial-property-set
  fo:inline-container
  fo:marker
  fo:multi-properties
  fo:multi-property-set
  fo:multi-switch
  fo:multi-toggle
  fo:region-end
  fo:region-start
  fo:retrieve-marker
  fo:table-caption 
  fo:title


2. A not insignificant, category of tasks is to decide upon and 
  implement all reasonable properties required by the specification. This 
  also means that at this point, until further review, no FO can be considered 
  to be compliant. 
  This are the properties which must be implemented to reach basic conformance

  a) CHANGED 
   space-after.optimum (Incomplete) 
   space-before.optimum (Incomplete) 
   keep-with-next (Changed)

  b) NEW 
   alignment-adjust                                       
   alignment-baseline
   baseline-shift                                         
   block-progression-dimension                            
   border-after-precedence
   border-before-precedence
   border-end-precedence
   border-start-precedence
   clip                                                   
   content-type                                           
   direction                                              
   display-align                                          
   dominant-baseline                                      
   font-variant                                           
   format                                                 
   grouping-separator                                     
   grouping-size                                          
   inline-progression-dimension                           
   keep-with-next                                     
   keep-with-previous                                     
   letter-value                                           
   line-stacking-strategy                                 
   number-columns-repeated       
   number-columns-spanned        
   number-rows-spanned           
   orphans                       
   overflow                      
   reference-orientation         
   relative-align                
   role                          
   source-document               
   space-after (full)
   space-before (full)
   space-end                     
   space-start                   
   visibility                    
   widows                        
   writing-mode                  
   z-index                       

3. A third category of tasks is the ongoing effort to promote maintainability, 
   write  more and better documentation, and to refine the build process. 
  a) add examples. In examples/fo there should be at least one file for each 
     supported flow object showing the use of all properties applying to it.


**** Bugs ****

- colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page 
- keep-next doesn't work and doubles the text lines which should be moved to the next page
- border width in fo:table is added to the start position of the next block or
  table (see page 6 in examples/fo/table.fo for a test case)
- if a block, which is positioned with space-before, doesn't fit on the current page, 
  it gets lost. (see space-before.fo in bugtests/fo for a test case)


SVG 
- SVG linearGradients don't appear the same as in other SVG Viewers
