**** THINGS WORKED ON *****

redesign/refactoring - page layout [Arved Sandstrom]
svg, testing [Keiron Liddle]


**** THINGS TO DO ****


1)
The immediate list of things that need to be done. These include things
that may prevent other activity or could be done independantly.

* Redesign of flow layout handling, breaks keeps, spacing etc.
* Redesign/factoring of line area handling.
* Testing system, moving old tests to new system etc.
* SVG
- integrating Avalon and Fop
- Documentation / website needs to better help users understand how to use FOP
- examples (a separate set of user fo examples)

(* being worked on,  - no current activity)

2)
After the the layout handling is redesigned then these items should be
promoted to first priority.
These should be done with the aim of getting to basic conformance.

- Implement all remaining formatting objects
- improve property handling for types not currently supported (eg. 'large' font)
- implement all required properties

3)
Nail down external interfaces (the main part is fairly stable).
Setting base directory, using config, logging, extensions etc.

Interfaces to include:
how does FOP get called
how does the formatter interface to renderers
how do people write new plug-ins: handlers for new image types
processors for fo:instream-foreign-object

4)
Improve the code. Follow the Sun Java coding guidelines.
Have better comments and correlation between spec terms
and methods etc.
