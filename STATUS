STATUS

Things to do:

Get images working
[PARTIAL] Incorporate Arved Sandstrom's simple-link implementation
[PARTIAL] Implement basic keeps
[PARTIAL] Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's further table fixes

Other Bugs to fix:

colour not continued onto subsequent pages if coloured block goes over page

Todo's and problems with AWT Previewer:

- currently the layout process uses PDF fonts. This gives sometimes
  trouble with java.awt.Font 
- we need some progress messages even if the process itself is fast
- GIF format is supported by the viewer, but disabled in FOP. BMP is
  not done, because there are no standard libraries.
- more comments/english comments
- print output using AWT
- i18n for the user interface (yes, now we need this stuff)
- toolbar images directory is not configurable
- first preview is painted twice (flashing screen)
- should "preview" be an option when calling FOP instead of having
  it's own main method?

Done:

Make sure Makefiles work
Switch to using Status object as return from layout()
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's fix to tables in static-content
Incorporate Kelly Campell's fixes to GifJpegImage
Incorporate Eric Schaeffer's background colour implementation
  (actually used different approach with background colour as trait)
