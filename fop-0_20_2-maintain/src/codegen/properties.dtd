     other property family the referenced attribute is defined. This is
     used to let SVG reuse font-related properties defined in FO.
     The family attribute is ignored if type isn't "ref".
     If type = "generic", this is not a "real" property but rather a
     template on which one or usually several other properties are
     based. This reduces typing in the properties files and can reduce the
     number and size of property classes created.

<!-- This indicates that this property is based on a generic property
     datatype. This may be one hand-coded, such as SVGLengthProperty, or it
     may be one which is created by a generic property definition in the
     properties.xml file being processed. The content of this element is
     the CLASSNAME of the generic property (NOTE: not its name). A property
     can be based on a generic property and still override certain aspects
     such as the default value, simply by specifying the appropriate
     sub-elements.
     If the "ispropclass" attribute = "true", then the contents of the
     use-generic element is the name of a hard-coded Property subclass
     and not of a generated Property.Maker subclass. This is currently
     only used for the SVG properties, because they don't have a
     rule-based relationship between the actual Property class name
     and the name of the datatype stored by objects of that class.

<!-- This element is used to specify the allowable values for enumerated

     specifies a possible value for the property. The "const" attribute for
     each value is used to generate a public static constant value in the
     class which can be referenced in code to test the property value. It
     must be a legal Java identifier. By convention, use all caps.

<!-- This gives the default value for a property if it is not specified on
     a given FO. (The spec calls this the "initial" value.)

     It may also be used to specify a default value for a particular
     component of a compound property. This is used to give each component
     its initial value if components are only partially specified in the
     FO file.

     NOTE: It should be an expression which can be parsed to give a legal
     value for the property! This can't be checked by the generating
     script, so if there is a problem, it will only be seen at runtime.
     If the attribute "contextdep" is present and set to "true", the
     generated code for the Maker will create a new Property object each
     time it is asked to make the default value. Otherwise (the usual
     case), it will only make one Property object with the default value
     and return it on each call. Context-dependent default values include
     those specified with relative units (eg. 1em).

     The "subproperty" attribute can be used on properties which are
     based on generic property specifications to specify a default value
     for a particular component. For example, the border-end-width property
     is based on GenericCondBorderWidth and specifies a specific default
     for the "conditionality" component.

<!-- The datatype-conversion element(s) specify how to handle property
     values which can be specified in several ways. For example, the
     line-height property can be specified as a Length, or as a number or
     as a percent, which are both interpreted as being a factor of the
     current font-size. The datatype for this property is Length. The
     datatype-conversion element is used to handle the cases in which the
     Property parser returns a type which is not a Length. Each element
     tests it against a possible property type. The content gives the
     actual code which should be inserted in the generated class in order
     to correctly initialize the property value.
     NOTE: the use of this for Color properties is rather a hack. All color
     properties can be specified by a large number of keywords. To be
     consistent with my logic we should use the keyword-equiv element. But
     that was a lot of work. So for now, if the value evaluates to a String
     and not to a ColorType, the datatype-conversion just uses it to
     directly initialize a ColorType object.

<!-- The attribute from-type gives a possible property datatype, such as
     Number or String. The varname gives the name of a variable which can
     be used in the content of the datatype-conversion element. If the type
     of the variable is not the same as from-type, it may be specified with
     the attribute vartype.

     An example of usage is from the line-height property. This should be
     a Length object, but may be specified as a Number, which is interpreted
     as though it were a percentage of the current font-size.

<!-- The compound element indicates that the property is a "compound"
     property as defined in the XSL specification. It is specified as one
     or more individual attributes whose names are built up from the base
     property name and the name of a compoent. Each "subproperty" element
     describes a component of a compound property.
     An example is space-before.
-->
<!ELEMENT compound (subproperty+) >

     Length.

<!ELEMENT subproperty (name, datatype, auto-ok?, default?, corresponding?,

<!-- This element which may be repeated, specifies keyword shorthands for
     non-enumerated properties. For example, the border-width family of
     properties can be specified either by a Length (eg. 1pt) or by one of
     the keywords "thin", "medium", or "thick", each of which corresponds
     to a "user-agent specific value" (XSL Spec.) These values are defined
     by the keyword-equiv element. The "match" attribute gives the string
     keyword value and the content is the replacement value, which should
     be able to be evaluated to produce an object of the property's
     datatype (such as Length). An example is:
        <keyword-equiv match="thin" eval="true">0.5pt</keyword-equiv>
     The "eval" attribute indicates whether the specified value must be
     "parsed" using the Property parser or whether it can be used to
     directly construct an object of the appropriate datatype. The default
     is to evaluate the specified value (like the default specification).

<!-- This element if present indicates that percent specifications are

     FONTSIZE - the value is a percent of the current font-size
     INH-FONTSIZE - the value is a percent of the inherited
     font-size. This is necessary because font-size itself can be specified
     as a percent!
     CONTAINING-BOX - the value is a percent of the appropriate
     dimension of the containing box of this FO.
     If none of these is specified, the content of the element is
     assumed to be a Java expression which can be used to calculate an
     absolute value. This expression can assume that the variables
     propertyList and fo are in scope and refer to the FO on which the
     property was specified as a percent.

     The "from" attribute gives the name of the property from which this
     property is derived.
     Each "if" sub-element specifies a possible value. The "match"
     attribute is compared with the value of the "derive-from" property. If
     it is equal, the value of the current property is set to the value

<!-- This element indicates that the value of the property is the same as

     if the "use-if-specified" attribute has the value "true", then the
     corresponding property value takes precedence over the property on
     which it is specified. To be conformant to the specification, all the
     the "absolute" versions of properties have precedence.
     Example: if a get() call is made on padding-end for a FO using lr-tb
     writing-mode, then the padding-right property will be used if it is
     specified, even if padding-end is actually specified.
     However, if a get() is made on padding-right, the value of padding-end
     will only be used if padding-right isn't specified on the FO.

     expression "padding-<wmabs2rel dir='LEFT'/>". The wmabs2rel element
     is replaced by the writing-mode relative direction which corresponds
