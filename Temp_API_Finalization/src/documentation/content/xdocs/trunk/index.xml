      <p>
        <strong>FOP Trunk</strong> is the name for the current development code as found in the 
        <a href="ext:svn-repo/trunk">Subversion repository</a>. This section of the FOP provides
        the documentation for this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apache FOP team is proud to present to you the largely rewritten codebase which is 
        finally in a state where you can start to use it. It has taken over three years to get this
        far and over two years without a new release from the FOP project. We would like to encourage 
        you to download the code and to play with it. We're still in the process of adding new major
        features and stabilizing the code. We welcome any feedback you might have and even more, any
        other form of help to get the project forward.
