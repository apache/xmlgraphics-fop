What is FOP?
------------

Apache FOP is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects. It is a Java
application that reads a formatting object tree conforming to the XSL 1.1
Recommendation (05 December 2006) and then turns it into a PDF document,
certain other output formats or allows you to preview it directly on screen.
Note that not all parts of the XSL 1.1 specification have yet been
implemented.

Apache FOP is part of Apache's XML Graphics project. The homepage of Apache 
FOP is http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/.

How do I build FOP?
-------------------

If you've downloaded a binary distribution, you don't need to build
FOP.

Otherwise, please follow the instructions found here:
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/stable/compiling.html

[TEMPORARY]

Until the above referenced instructions are updated, one of the following
may be used to build FOP:

Building with Maven (preferred)

% mvn clean install

Building with Ant (deprecated)

% ant -f fop/build.xml clean all

How do I run FOP?
-----------------

Simply by typing "fop" on the command-line. Without any parameters you
will receive a screen with instruction on how to call FOP from the
command-line.

For more details, see:
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/stable/running.html

[TEMPORARY]

Note that FOP command line scripts and build results from ant will be found
under the ./fop sub-directory.

  text using embedded TrueType fonts. (BD) Thanks to Adam Strzelecki,
  Victor Mote. Fixes 5535.

* The Java2DRenderer (and therefore the print and bitmap renderers) is
  now offering the same quality as the PDF and PS renderers. Note:
  There can still be little differences between PDF and Print/PNG/TIFF
