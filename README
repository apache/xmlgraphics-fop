FOP: An Open-Source XSL Formatter and Renderer

What is FOP?

FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
objects. It is a Java 1.1 application that reads a formatting object
tree and then turns it into a PDF document. The formatting object
tree, can be in the form of an XML document (output by an XSLT engine
like XT or Xalan) or can be passed in memory as a DOM Document or (in
the case of XT) SAX events.


A. Compiling FOP

1. Prerequisites

   a) Java 1.1.x or later

   b) XT from James Clark

      Some of the Java source code in FOP is generated from XML using
      XSLT. XT must be used to generate this code. 

      XT is an XSL stylesheet processor written in java. At the moment
      you can't use any other processor, because the make file makes
      use of some proprietary features of Clark's xt which allow to
      write output in more then one document. You can find XT at
      <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html>
      You have to use XT version 19991105 or later.

      (Under windows you shouldn't use the prepackaged xt.exe but also
      the generic jar file, otherwise make won't work)

      XT relies on an sax parser like XP (also J. Clark), which can be
      downloaded at <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xp/index.html>

   c) make

      Under windows it has been reported that the use of the cygnus
      solutions port of the GNU utilities works. You can find it at 
      <http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/>



B. Running FOP

1) Prerequisites

   Following software must be installed:

   a) Java 1.1.x or later

   b) A sax parser like XP <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xp/index.html>.

   c) If you have to produce the formatting objects files, which are
      the input for FOP, you need a transformation utility to create
      this files from your xml files. 
      Normally this is an XSLT stylesheet processor like XT
      <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html> or XALAN
      <http://xml.apache.org/xalan/index.html>.

2) Starting FOP as an standalone application

   There are two ways of running FOP from the command line.

   Method One

   One is to first use an XSLT engine to produce the formatting object
   tree as an XML document and then running the class
   org.apache.fop.apps.CommandLine with the formatting object file
   name and PDF filename as arguments. You will need to include FOP,
   SAX and your SAX Parser in your classpath and so you might invoke 

   java -cp fop_x_xx_x.jar;sax.jar;xp.jar
   org.apache.fop.apps.CommandLine formatting-tree-file pdf-file

   If your SAX Parser is other than XP, you will need to set the property
   org.xml.sax.parser to the SAX Parser class to use.

   Method Two

   Rather than performing transformation with an XSLT before invoking
   FOP, it is possible, if you use XT as your XSLT engine, to just
   call FOP and have it call XT for you. To do this, run the class
   org.apache.fop.apps.CommandLine with the source XML file name, XSL
   file name and PDF file name as arguments. You will need to include
   FOP, SAX, your SAX Parser and XT in your classpath and so you might
   invoke 

   java -cp fop_x_xx_x.jar;sax.jar;xp.jar;xt.jar
   org.apache.fop.apps.XTCommandLine xml-file xsl-file pdf-file

   Again, if your SAX Parser is other than XP, you will need to set
   the property org.xml.sax.parser to the SAX Parser class to use.

   Note: If you are using java 2 or later (i.e. jdk 1.2. or later) you
   can put all needed jar files into the subdirectory
   jdk1.2.x\jre\lib\ext (windows example). Then FOP can be started
   without classpath:  

   java org.apache.fop.apps.CommandLine formatting-tree-file pdf-file
